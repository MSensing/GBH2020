# GBH2020
Here, we provide a 150-m global urban building heights dataset around 2020 by combining the spaceborne lidar (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, GEDI), multi-sourced data (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1), and topographic data.

The GEE_process is the GEE code for the collection and pre-processing of the independent variables.
